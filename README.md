# SJSU CS146 (Data Structure and Alogirthms) MazeGenerator Project

## Introduction
This is the my MazeGenerator Project from CS146 @ SJSU. This project creates a perfect maze (only one solution, one way from one cell to another) and solves it using Breath and Depth First Algorithms (BFS/DFS). It also uses the Queue, List, Linked List, and Array data structures. 

## Goal 
The goal of this project was to implement BFS and DFS in a real project example. 

## Technologies 
Java 

## How to run 
- Make sure you have Java installed on your computer 
  - Windows: Open the command prompt and type ``java -version``
  - Mac/Linux: Open the terminal and type ``java -version``
